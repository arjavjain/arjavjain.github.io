<p align=center>Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution increased the curiosity on animals .Before it,people thought
that animals remain same throughout there life but Theory of Evolution says that animals evolve
gradually from common ancestors.Some species survived through a process called "natural selection,
"where species that successfully adapted to meet the changing requirements of their natural habitat
thrived , while those that failed to evolve and reproduce,those species died off and got extinct.According to charles darwin "survival is idiotism".
